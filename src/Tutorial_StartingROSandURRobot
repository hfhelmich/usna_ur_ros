HOW TO START UR ROBOT ROS INTERFACE


*** First go to the UR Robot:
1) Turn on the UR Robot
2) Initialize the robot by powering on and starting it at the initialization screen
3) Set the robot to "Local Mode" and navigate to the "Run" tab in the upper left hand corner
4) Click "Load Program" on the left hand side of the teach pendant.
5) Select "ExCtrl_1.0.5.urp" and then "Open" at the bottom of the screen.
6) You should see the file populate on the left hand side and at the top of the screen.

*** Go to the computer running the ROS interface code:
1) Open a terminal window
2) Type "roscore" to start the ros core functionality in that terminal
3) Open a new terminal tab or window by pressing "ctrl+shit+t" (for a new tab) or "ctrl+shift+n" (for a new window)
4) In the new window, type the command "roslaunch usna_urx robot_interface_URx.launch" and press enter. This will UDP the connection to the UR robot and begin publishing/receiving topics from the robot. The robot can be in "Remote" or "Local" mode.

*** Return to the UR teach pendant:
1) In the Run Program window, press the play button at the bottom of the screen. You should see a number of variables appear in the table/window on the right side of the screen. The status should change to "Running".
2) Change the robot's mode from "Local" to "Remote". The complete system is now ready to use.
